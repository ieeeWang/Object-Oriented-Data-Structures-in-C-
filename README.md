It is a nice (intermediate-level) open course to recall the way how C++ manage the memory (as well as the complicated syntax), which is not needed anymore when using modern languages (e.g., python and Java).

The homeworks are done in a Linux compatible C++ work environment on (1) PC using the Windows Sub-system for Linux [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and (2) Creating a Environment on [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/).

(1) in WSL, Download the packages used for C++ by running the following commands in the Bash terminal:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install gcc g++ clang make gdb valgrind graphviz imagemagick git zip unzip

(2) C++ Environment Setup on AWS Cloud9:

sudo yum install -y gcc72 gcc72-c++
